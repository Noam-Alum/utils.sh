A collection of functions to make scripting in bash easier.

### How to use

You either download the script to your computer, then source it from there:
```bash
source /path/to/utils.sh
```
Or source it using `curl` and the raw link from this GitHub repository:
```bash
source <(curl -Ls "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Noam-Alum/utils.sh/main/utils.sh")
```
Note that by using curl each time the script runs you'd have to wait for a response with the functions.

* You can use a version that includes only the functions - `utils-min.sh`.
